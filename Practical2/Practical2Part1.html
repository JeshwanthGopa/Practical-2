                    wanted to join my friend for a non-caffeinated beverages at Bytes and I became reacquainted with
                    the combination of fizzy water and artificial fruit syrup. Italian sodas are not so sweet as a
                    normal soda and not so boring as a flavoured carbonated water. The Italian sodas at bytes also
                    have cream in them (or maybe they do if you ask; I haven’t tried), which makes it a nice coffee
                    shop alternative for the times when you’re feeling a refreshing drink that doesn’t have caffeine
                    or milk.</p>
